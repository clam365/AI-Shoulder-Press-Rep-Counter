# AI-Shoulder-Press-Rep-Counter
- Engineered a deep custom learning model leveraging frameworks like MediaPipe and OpenCV, training it to  accurately detect and track the movement of shoulder press exercises using Python.
- Analyzing body movements using techniques such as post estimation on 6 keypoint detection, enabling the system to accurately identify start and end of each shoulder press repetition.
